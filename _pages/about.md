I am Vinícius Muraro, a Postdoctoral Researcher at Lund University in Sweden, working within the Department of Design Sciences and affiliated with the [Centre for Innovation Research (CIRCLE)](https://www.circle.lu.se/) and the [Spårbanken Skåne Centre for Sustainable Enterprising (SSCEN)](https://www.lusem.lu.se/organisation/research-centres/sparbanken-skane-centre-sustainable-enterprising). I hold a Ph.D. in Science and Technology Policy from the University of Campinas (UNICAMP), Brazil, where I focused on the application of big data and machine learning in foresight studies. My professional background spans academia, consulting, and research in innovation systems, R&D impact evaluation, and technology foresight, with contributions across sectors such as healthcare, agribusiness, and public policy.


# Research Interests

My research lies at the intersection of **science policy, foresight studies, and digitalization**. I specialize in:
- Using bibliometrics, social network analysis, and altmetrics to map and assess scientific production.
- Exploring the role of AI and big data in futures studies, specifically in the context of **science, technology, and innovation (STI)** policy.
- Investigating collaboration dynamics in scientific research, especially the impact of inequalities between low- and high-income countries on research outcomes.
I am actively engaged in projects funded by both Swedish and Brazilian institutions, with recent work addressing **artificial intelligence's role in Sweden’s innovation landscape** and the development of value chains for Amazonian plants.


# Teaching and Mentorship

I am passionate about guiding students and fostering an engaging learning environment. At Lund University, I teach courses such as **Introduction to International Business** and have previously led sessions in **Prospective and Decision Support in STI** at UNICAMP. I aim to equip students with critical skills for analyzing complex systems, combining insights from my research in foresight and evaluation with real-world applications.
