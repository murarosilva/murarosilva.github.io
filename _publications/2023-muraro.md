## Abstract
This research paper explores the impact of ChatGPT, an AI-based tool, in pedagogical contexts. The author provides reflections and recommendations based on his experience teaching a bachelor course in international business. The paper outlines specific guidelines and recommendations for the use of AI tools in education, including encouraging teachers to familiarize themselves with AI tools, ensuring that AI tools are subordinated to the course's learning outcomes, and recommending a contribution statement for group assignments. The paper also discusses the potential positive and negative effects of using ChatGPT in the classroom and provides recommendations for its effective use. Overall, the paper suggests that ChatGPT can be a valuable tool for enhancing student learning and engagement, but that its use should be carefully considered and integrated into the course in a way that aligns with specific learning outcomes and assessment methods.
