## Introduction
This paper explores the role of Brazilian research institutions in the global and national context of study of medicinal plants. Most of these plants have ethnopharmacological use and herbal medicines related to the Amazon. It highlights Brazil's position in scientific production and the importance of Amazonian resources in developing phytomedicines. The study aims to provide an overview of the technical-scientific production of medicinal plants and herbal medicines related to the Amazon, focusing on scientific impact, collaboration, Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of scientific production, and innovation system maturity.

## Methods
The study employs a comprehensive methodological approach, including data collection from Scopus covering the period from 2002 to 2022. The data was cleaned and analyzed using bibliometric and network analysis techniques. Advanced natural language processing techniques, such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation and Jaccard distance measure, were used for TRL classification.

## Results
The findings reveal a predominant contribution from Brazilian institutions and authors, with 1,850 publications analyzed. Key areas identified include Pharmacology, Toxicology, Pharmaceuticals, Medicine, and Biochemistry. The study also uncovers various collaborative networks and technological maturity levels, with a significant focus on early-stage development phases.

## Discussion
The research concludes that Brazilian institutions, particularly those in the Amazon region, play a significant role in the scientific exploration and development of medicinal plants and herbal medicines. Despite this, countries like the USA were proportionally more productive in clinical trial research. The study underscores the potential of Brazil's rich biodiversity and traditional knowledge in the pharmaceutical industry, particularly for neglected diseases. It suggests the need for stronger research systems and international collaboration to leverage these resources for global health benefits.
