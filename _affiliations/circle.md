CIRCLE is the Centre for Innovation Research at Lund University. It functions as incubator, coordinator, and implementer of innovation research across faculties. CIRCLE strives to provide an attractive research environment with strong national and international networks.

Our aim is to understand and explain how innovation can contribute to a good society and tackle societal challenges such as economic crises, climate change or the increased globalization of economic activities. This requires advanced insights into

how knowledge is created and diffused in organizations, networks, regions, countries, and globally
how knowledge is turned into innovations
which societal conditions promote or hinder the creation and diffusion of innovation
what intended and unintended societal consequences innovations have.
